                    print (cnt)
		    keyboardController.press(Key.up)
                    keyboardController.release(Key.up)
		elif isFinishCal is True and cnt == 2:
                      print (cnt)
		      keyboardController.press(Key.down)
                      keyboardController.release(Key.down)
		elif isFinishCal is True and cnt == 3:
                      print (cnt)
		      keyboardController.press(Key.left)
                      keyboardController.release(Key.left)
		elif isFinishCal is True and cnt == 4:
                      print (cnt)
